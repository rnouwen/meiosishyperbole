                   meets metaphor, hyperbole or meiosis},

  year =          {2016},
  abstract =      {This philosophical-pragmatic paper discusses several
                   forms of irony which rest on other figures of speech
                   contingent on overt untruthfulness, namely the
                   figures arising as a result of flouting the first
                   maxim of Quality. It is argued that an ironic
                   implicature may be piggybacked on another
                   implicature, called “as if implicature”,
                   originating from flouting the first maxim of Quality
                   occasioned by metaphor. Metaphorical irony, which is
                   subject to the irony-after-metaphor order of
                   interpretation, exhibits a number of manifestations
                   depending on the nature and scope of irony, and the
                   scope of the subordinate metaphor. On the other hand,
                   rather than giving rise to an as if implicature
                   distinct from the irony-based one, hyperbole and
                   meiosis, which are inherently evaluative, most
                   typically overlap with ironically evaluative
                   expressions, promoting meiotic and hyperbolic irony,
                   frequently (wrongly, as will be claimed here)
                   considered by researchers to rely on flouting
                   Quantity maxims. However, cases of independent use of
                   hyperbole or meiosis in ironic environment are also
                   possible. Such invite two levels of untruthfulness
                   and two implicatures.},

  abstract =      {Significance Human communication is rife with
                   nonliteral language, ranging from metaphor to irony
                   to hyperbole. How do people go so far beyond the
                   literal meaning of an utterance to infer the
                   speaker’s intended meaning? We present a
                   computational model that understands hyperbolic and
                   other nonliteral uses of number words (e.g., “That
                   watch costs 10,000 dollars”). Our model integrates
                   empirically measured background knowledge, principles
                   of communication, and reasoning about communicative
                   goals to explain the computational basis of
                   nonliteral language understanding. This framework
                   sheds light on the nature of communication, marking a
                   significant advancement in the flexibility and
                   richness of formal models of language understanding.
                   , One of the most puzzling and important facts about
                   communication is that people do not always mean what
                   they say; speakers often use imprecise, exaggerated,
                   or otherwise literally false descriptions to
                   communicate experiences and attitudes. Here, we focus
                   on the nonliteral interpretation of number words, in
                   particular hyperbole (interpreting unlikely numbers
                   as exaggerated and conveying affect) and pragmatic
                   halo (interpreting round numbers imprecisely). We
                   provide a computational model of number
                   interpretation as social inference regarding the
                   communicative goal, meaning, and affective subtext of
                   an utterance. We show that our model predicts
                   humans’ interpretation of number words with high
                   accuracy. Our model is the first to our knowledge to
                   incorporate principles of communication and
                   empirically measured background knowledge to
                   quantitatively predict hyperbolic and pragmatic halo
                   effects in number interpretation. This modeling
                   framework provides a unified approach to nonliteral
                   language understanding more generally.},

  abstract =      {Recent advances in computational cognitive science
                   (i.e., simulation-based probabilistic programs) have

                   implementable models of pragmatics. Rather than
                   describing a pragmatic reasoning process in prose,
                   these models formalize and implement one, deriving
                   both qualitative and quantitative predictions of
                   human behavior -- predictions that consistently prove
                   correct, demonstrating the viability and value of the
